## Recommendations

**17. If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
 * As a previous financial planner I had to obtain a license from the government in order to provide recommendations to various businesses and clients for the products that were available to them.
With next insurance being completely digital I noticed the do not sell specific products related to individual life and living benefits (such as critical illness and disability.) Can this be implemented without underwriters ( individuals needed to make decisions about certain clients when applying for certain products) or will they still be essential for the decision making. 
 

**18. Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
* Allow them to further diversify clientele that they weren’t necessarily  able to reach who also hold a big share of the market. They are also only available currently in United states of America, adding more consistent products that of which can also benefit other parts of North Americans as well.  

 **19. What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?**

  **20.  Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
* These technologies are appropriate because I want to see more AI and machine based technology to be apart of the underwritting process. I do believe a lot of this is being done by humans and further technology humans use weather that be blood/ urine work done by doctors to further assess certain clients health. Previously working for a big bank tele phone interviews were also a big thing being done by humans.
